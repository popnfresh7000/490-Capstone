# The Development Team

## Product Owners and Leadership

Helming the development of this expansion pack is the Leadership team, broken down into the following hierarchy.

### Product Owners

The Product Owners drive the final decisions related to development. Their word is law, and even they are broken into their own specialties. They are the...

#### Creative Director

    Responsible for all of the content within the game itself. The CD holds the creative     vision for the game as a whole and how all of the pieces should come together to     make something fun for the players.

#### Executive Producer

    Responsible for the project as a whole and the logistics outside of the game itself.     The EP controls budget, staffing, dependencies, and in general makes sure the game     is delivered on time and on budget.

The Product Owners should be able to always come to agreeable compromises that drive development forward. If the Creative Director wants to add a new feature to the game, the Executive Producer will say how that feature impacts development timelines and what other parts the game would need to be scoped back to accomodate. If the Executive Producer wants to cut something to save time or money, the Creative Director will know what sort of knock on effects that could mean for the player experience. 

### Leadership

Supporting the Product Owners is the rest of the Leadership Team. These leaders are decision makers that are trusted to run the day-to-day operations of the development team, only escalating the most important or polarizing issues to the Product Owners. Their roles are fairly self-explanatory

#### Art Director

    Directs the art! Ensures a consistent style is used across the game in each of the     different sub-disciplines of art such as Character and Environment. Reviews and     approves all art assets

#### Design Director

    Directs the design! Drives a cohesive and fun moment-to-moment gameplay     experience across each of the different sub-disciplines of design such as Quest and     World. Reviews and approves all design decisions

Both of these Director positions report to the Creative Director, as they both oversee content. The Executive Producer has a team of Producers working under them, each tracking the time and scope of the different departments driving development. 

## Development Disciplines

### Art

The Art team is the largest team on the project with a broad range of skillsets and specialties.

#### Environment

The largest part of the art team, producing a variety of content. Environment Artists create all of the 3D assets in the game world that do not rely on character interactions. These assets include architecture, vegetation, objects, and decorations. Environment Artists are also responsible for bringing all of these elements together to create cohesive Areas of Interest.

#### Character

Character Artists create not only the in-game characters and enemies, but anything those characters need to interact with such as weapons. They need to be aware of player heights and scale with other characters in the world and ensure anything interactables they make fit within all of those scales.

#### VFX

VFX artists create all of the visual effects in the game. Everything from explosions to small particles. This includes things such as the splash of rain hitting the ground, plumes of smoke from a chimney, and first breath from a dragon's mouth.

#### Concept

Concept artists lay a lot of the ground work for the other artists to follow, usually creating multiple variations of the same thing that the Art Director then pulls elements from to create a final piece that the other artists can use for modeling. Though most of their work is early in the development process, they are also valuable throughout production, as they frequently take work in progress 3D art and paint over it to quickly show visual possibilities that would otherwise be time consuming to try in 3D

#### Animation

Usually working hand-in-hand with the character artists to create all of the animations for the different characters in the game. Animators also create new animation rigs when the need arises, which can be time intensive but integral to the process. Rigs act as a sort of skeleton that the animators work with.

#### 2D

2D Artists are very similar to concept artists, but they specialize in a lot of the smaller, two dimensional elements within the game. This includes things like icons, health bars, and other UI elements that typically have very little fidelity but need to communicate important information at a glance.

#### Terrain

Terrain Artists are almost as much engineers as they are artists. 3D terrain tools are highly technical, and changes to the terrain can have surprisingly big impacts on the rest of the world. Terrain artists also need to do scripting for anything in the game world that is developed progromatically, such as the rules for which plants grow in which areas.

### Design

The Design team is a lean, integral part of development, and has the biggest impact on the player experience.

#### World

World Designers are a fairly technical breed of designer, and responsible for a lot of the behind-the-scenes moment-to-moment elements of the game. They do things such as place enemies to control combat experiences, create navigational puzzles, and handle all of the scripting within the game world.

#### Quest

Quest Designers represent the narrative side of design. They create the game's lore, write character dialog, and ensure an engaging story is told through fun and rewarding player quests.

#### Systems

System Designers are the "paper design" gurus. They come up with rewards for players, and intricate, intermingling systems for the player to interact with.

#### Creature

Creature Designers create all of the skills and abilities of the enemies in the game that players need to fight. More importantly, they are responsible for the balance of those abilities, ensuring that players can feel challenged without being overwhelmed

#### Audio

Not entirely design focused, Audio Engineers create all of the sounds heard in the game. They usually take their cues from the VFX artists, ensuring that anything that creates a visual effect has a cool sounding audio beat to go with it.
